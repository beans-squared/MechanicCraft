### CHANGELOG for MechanicCraft 0.4.0

This update *should* be compatible with existing worlds, however, any mobs, items or blocks from End: Reborn will vanish. Just a warning!

### New Features

- Added Moar Tinkers
  - New materials for tools, weapons and armor!
- Added Tweaker's Construct
- Added ModTweaker
- Added Tinker's Extras


### Gameplay Changes

- Tweaked beheading mechanic
  - The chance of beheading is no longer affected by tools, and now randomly occurs on 5% of hits
- Reverted vanilla sleeping mechanics (beds now set your spawnpoint)
- Cow in a Jar is back! I swear, it's totally humane...
- Kitchen sinks no longer provide infinte water and now must be supplied with water via piping.. I totally didn't abuse this at all...
- The Scanner now stores and uses x10 the energy
  - Basically you'll be able to use it for as long as before on a single charge, but charging the scanner to full will now take longer (particularly in early game)
- The Faraday Suit is back: protect yourself from those dangerous tesla coils!
- The Ear Defenders are back: because factories are loud and your ears don't like that.
- The hammers to be used with the crushing table have been renamed to Mallets, to avoid confusion with the Hammer from Tinker's Construct
- All variants of TiC tool tables will now show in JEI
  - No worries, you can craft those tables without steelleaf! You always could, it just didn't show.
- You can now melt aluminium chunks in the smeltery...
  - ...however, they melt into water for the moment. This will be fixed in a later patch.
- Updated the death and respawning mechanics
  - All XP is now preserved on death, instead of just a percentage
  - All items in your hotbar are kept on death, however tools will lose 10% of their remaining durability and energy items will lose half their charges
  - Any energy items dropped on death (not in hotbar) will completely lose their charge
  - Return scrolls can now be crafted, which allows you to teleport to your death location
- Added Mekanism's salt to the dustSaltPeter oreDictEntry
  - In layman's terms, you can now craft gunpowder using this kind of salt.
- Tweaked the scanner's crafting recipe
- Added some tooltips to machines, describing their max power usage or production
- Right click harvesting with your hand is now disabled
  - Try using a kama or scythe for the same effect!
- World backups are now disabled by default
  - They can still be enabled by going to config > ftbbackups.cfg and changing enablebackups to true
- Updated Discord Rich Presence
- Updated many quest icons with multiblock structure icons from Immersive Engineering and Immersive Technology
  - This is primarily a visual change
- An autocrafter research tree has been added to Industry: Mining > Metalworking (which has been renamed to Automated Production)

- Added subtitles to some quests
- Tweaked some research costs
