## CHANGELOG for MechanicCraft 0.14.1 (12.19.2020)

## New features:
- Server packs are back!
  - Now that I believe that I've reached a state where I think I have most if not all the mods I need for this pack, I can now include server pack releases with every version. Download the server packs alongside the standard client pack.
  - Public MechanicCraft server sometime in the future? Maybe! We shall see...

## Mods removed:
- The Comically Large Spoon
  - Sadly this mod crashes serverside, so it must go. MechanicCraft will never be the same without it...

### New features:

- Added the Codex: a guidebook aimed at providing an in-game wiki for the modpack

  - I don't care if this way sucks, I've changed this too many times now and I need to focus on other things for once

- Removed Extended Days
  - Buggy on multiplayer servers, causing flashing-sky syndrome
- Removed Splash Logo Color Fix

- Removed Twilight Forest
  - While a great mod, it's overused. Might come back, but will more than likely be replaced with something new :)
