CHANGELOG for §6MechanicCraft 0.9.0 §b(11.26.2020)

**This update should be compatabile with existing worlds, but you never know. Always make backups!**

§6New features:

- Added the Codex: a guidebook aimed at providing an in-game wiki for the modpack
  - Currently very WIP and contains few entries
- Finalized first draft of new quest structure
  - I don't care if this way sucks, I've changed this too many times now and I need to focus on other things for once

§6Added mods:

- Added Crates Felt Blu
  - This helps balance, as wooden crate's default behavior makes it too easy to get loads and loads of personal storage early game
- Added FTB Money
  - Implemented a basic shop, but this system will be expanded upon in future updates

§6Updated mods:

- Updated Ambience Extras
  - Bugfixes
- Updated Immersive Technology
  - Bugfixes, new stuff I haven't actually looked at yet

§6Removed mods:

- Removed Immersive Railroading
  - Increased load times, caused microfreezing when loading models in JEI and generally just not worth it
- Removed Better Title Screen
  - Will be moving to a new title screen mod by release, so stay tuned!
- Removed Extended Days
  - Buggy on multiplayer servers, causing flashing-sky syndrome
- Removed Splash Logo Color Fix
  - Might come back if I bother to bring back dark mode loading screen
- Removed Twilight Forest
  - While a great mod, it's overused. Might come back, but will more than likely be replaced with something new :)
- Removed Industrial Renewal
  - Awesome mod, adds too much other stuff to be worth it. Looking into replacements for the decorative parts in the future
- Removed Comforts
  - Sleeping bag functionality is included with traveler's backpack, and generally not worth keeping around anymore


§6Other changes:

- Cleaned up and removed old unused mod files
- Removed all project table recipes
- Removed old scripts for now-removed mods
- Updated tips
- Updated the configuration for Discord rich presence
  - Now displays the modpack name instead of "Minecraft"

§6Bugfixes:
