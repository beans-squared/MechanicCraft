MechanicCraft is a medium-sized modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2 with the objective to find ways of utilizing various technologies to aid you in surviving, thriving and conquering after crash-landing on an unknown distant world. Will you overcome the challenges of surviving on an alien world, or will you allow yourself to succumb to one of the many dangers that lurk around every corner, under every rock, and in every cave, biome and landscape you explore?

MechanicCraft is primarily a tech modpack, featuring many popular and tried-and-true technology mods from modded Minecraft's best and brighest mod developers. The main premise of MechanicCraft is the introduction of survival elements such as thrist, body temperature, and hostile alien creatures. The way to survive and overcome the challenge placed before you will always be based on technological innovation: to maintain a livable body temperature, you design and create equipment that serves to keep you alive in hot or cold environments.
