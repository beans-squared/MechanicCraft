#### News for MechanicCraft 0.14.0 (12.18.2020)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome back to another random update with no real theme!

Uh, new stuff:

- Added Genetics Reborn
	This might end up being a complement for Robotic Parts, or a complete 
	alternative, since they do similar things. We'll have to see.
- Added Security Craft
	Secure all the things!
- Time Speed Mod
	Double-length days are back! But so are the double-length nights - be ready!
- The IE Crusher can now give 2 dusts per metal chunk processed - 4x ore processing!

Fixed some bugs
Fixed some annoying stuff
Fixed uh idk

Writing news is hard.

Anyways feel free to leave thoughts on the issue tracker or in my discord!
