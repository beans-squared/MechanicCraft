Here, you will blog-style news with a short summary of some of the most 
important updates from the latest version. Be sure to check back here 
when you update your client,as there may be some important and 
interesting updates posted here!

Right, here's some of the major changes for 0.12.0:

- As you may have noticed, there's a brand new custom main menu! It's
currently a prototype, so make sure to let me know what you think of it
by creating a new issue on GitHub (or in the disscussions because 
apparently that's new)

- Better With Mods is back! I just couldn't live without it, apparently.
Fear not, I'm not turning this into a mega-grindy slog like SevTech. BWM
will have its purposes in the main gameplay.

Hope you enjoy the latest new stuff!
