#### News for MechanicCraft 0.13.0 (12.14.2020)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry for the extra day delay, turns out Linux is a pain to deal with. 
Anyways, here's the new stuff you might actually care about:

- Techguns
	Bringing the bang. Techguns is a weapons mod with a full technology
tree, sporting numerous types of guns, armor and ammo. This mod will likely
fill the mid to late game weapons and armor niche. 

- Vanilla Vistas hello, bye Lost Cities
	New terrain generation! Large rolling hills, long detailed terrain that
should inspire a bit of awe. I'll try to limit changes to terrain and world
generation for a while, as I understand these can be kind of frustrating for
players to have to deal with.

- Download Soundtracks Button
	See the new button on the left? MechanicCraft no longer ships with the
soundtracks themselves, to reduce filesize and download times. Clicking this
new button will download the soundtracks to the correct folder in your game.
This process runs on the main game thread, which means the game will freeze
until the download is complete. There's no way around this, I'm afraid, so
set aside 5 minutes or so for the download to do its thing!

As always, feel free to leave feedback using the issue tracker or my Discord
(both linked on the left).
