New Mods:
- spark
	This mod is a server performace profiler, designed to help hunt down and isolate the causes of lag on 
	servers by monitoring server ticks and memory usage.

- LagGoggles
	Used to find lag-causing entities in the world (machines, mobs, etc). 

Both of these work in singleplayer, but are most useful on servers where these kinds of issues 
can be common. Investigate each mod's wiki pages for more info on how to use them.
